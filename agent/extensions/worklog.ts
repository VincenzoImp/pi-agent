/**
 * Worklog: what the session remembers, at two horizons.
 *
 * Worklog, per session: the goal, the plan, decisions taken and work still open, kept in a
 * file rather than in the conversation. Compaction summarises what was said; it cannot
 * summarise what was never said, so a worklog outside the context survives it intact and is
 * re-injected the moment compaction lands.
 *
 * Lessons, across sessions: what went wrong in a way worth not repeating.
 *
 * Why re-injection rather than custom compaction instructions: Pi hands
 * `customInstructions` to the hook as a value and then reads its own local variable
 * (core/agent-session.js), so an extension cannot extend them. `SessionBeforeCompactResult`
 * offers only `cancel` and a complete replacement summary, and producing that costs a model
 * call on every compaction. Re-injection costs none.
 *
 * The worklog is an ordinary markdown file: the agent reads and writes it with the tools it
 * already has. This extension supplies only what those tools cannot — surviving compaction,
 * and the two commands.
